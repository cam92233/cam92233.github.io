    <h1>Tips on how to pay off student loans:</h1>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>If you ever get a lump sum of cash (holidays, birthday, graduation, etc.), always set aside some of that money towards the loans!</li>
            <li>Try modifying your current budget to accomodate increased loan payments (Ex. Instead of $400 a month on groceries/going out food, lower it to just groceries at $300 a month)</li>
            <li>ALWAYS pay off more than the required minimum payment each month</li>
            <li>Maybe start a little side job for extra cash (Ex. Uber on the weekends)</li>
            <li>If you are wanting to pay off these loans faster, stay motivated and stick with a plan!</li>
        </ul>
